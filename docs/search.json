One can show that linear system has an infinite number of solutions which are given by:\n\\[\n\\beta_1 = -7 -2t, \\qquad \\beta_2 = 3 - t, \\qquad \\beta_3 = 4 + 2t, \\qquad \\beta_4 = t\n\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is any real number.\nExercise: Verify by plugging in that the above assignment of variables is a solution of the linear system for any choice of \\(t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n(-7-2t) & - & 2 (3-t) & + & 4 (4+2t) & - & 8 t & = & 3 \\\\\n(-7-2t) & - & (3-t) & + & (4+2t) & - & t & = & -6 \\\\\n(-7-2t) & + & (3-t) & + & (4+2t) & + & t & = & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSince the linear system has an infinite number of solutions, there are an infinite number of cubic polynomials with a graph that passes through the given points.

Since there exists no solution, we call the linear system inconsistent.\n\n\nGeneral Linear Systems\nNow that we have seen specific example of linear sytems, letâ€™s look at the general definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Linear System\n\n\n\nA system of \\(m\\) linear equations in \\(n\\) variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) is called an \\(m \\times n\\) linear system.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{1n}x_n &= b_1 \\\\\na_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{2n}x_n &= b_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\na_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{mn}x_n &= b_m\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nAn assignment of the variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) is a solution of the linear system if it satisfies all \\(m\\) equations simultaneously.\n\nA linear system that has at least one solution is called consistent.\n\nA linear system with no solution is called inconsistent.\n\nA system is underdetermined if there are more variables than equations (\\(n &gt; m\\)).\n\nA system is overdetermined if there are more equations than variables (\\(m &gt; n\\)).\n\n\n\nHere are some questions about linear systems that we will soon be able to answer.\n\nWhat are the possible sizes of the solution set of a linear system?\nHow do we tell if a linear system is consistent?\nHow can we tell if a consistent linear system has a unique solution?\nHow do we find all solutions of a consistent linear system?\nHow can we find an approximate solution to an inconsistent linear system?\n\nThe answers to these questions are not obvious. For example, given what we have seen so far about linear systems it seems intuitive to conclude that any overdetermined linear system is inconsistent. Since the following linear system is consistent with solution \\(x = 1\\), \\(y=1\\), that intuition is incorrect.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx + y &= 2 \\\\\nx - y &= 0 \\\\\n2x + 3y &= 5\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo answer these questions and more we will first need to learn about matrices and vectors. For example, a linear system can be written much more consisely using matrices and vectors as:\n\\[\nA \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{x} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_n\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{b} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_1 \\\\\nb_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nb_m\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nand\n\n\\(A\\) is called the coefficient matrix\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is called the solution vector\n\\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is called the right-and-side vector",
